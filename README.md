# Hello Hungry Academy!

## What it is

This is a rails project that generates poems using Markov chains.
Users select the poems that they prefer. The poems that no one
selects die off. The ones that lots of people select will have
children, either through sexual reproduction or through asexual
reproduction with mutation. This will hopefully lead to the poems
evolving.

## Why I am proud

Not because it is the cleanest or best code (though it certainly
isn't the worst). Or even because it is completed (it’s not.
I’m still working on it). But basically I am proud because I
am entirely self taught. I taught myself enough rails, css, and
javascript to do this while working a full time job. I think that
shows a certain level of commitment and talent. My skills will
only improve when I am given actual instruction, guidance, and
permission to work on rails between the hours of 8 and 5.

The site is still in progress, but even so, it doesn't look
terrible in a webkit browser. Check out a live version at
