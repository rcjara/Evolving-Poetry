# About

This is a Rails project which allows visitors to guide the "evolution" of poetry generated using markov chains.  As of the last check-in, this site is live at
www.nonsenseengine.com.

The about page on the site itself (www.nonsenseengine.com/about) has a much better explanation of what the site is going for.

It was made to scratch my own itch and as a learning experience, so I've only really tested it in Safari.  Apologies other browser users.

# Notes

Most of the interesting code involved with actually generating poetry is found in lib/custom/markov.

Most of the code in the app/ directory is in need of a good refactoring, which is at the top of my todo list.
