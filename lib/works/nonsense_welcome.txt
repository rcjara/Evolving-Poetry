@Welcome Text
Welcome to Nonsense Engine.
Welcome to odd randomness that is random.
Welcome, from the bottom of our hearts.
Welcome, though we only have randomness to offer you.
Welcome is what you say to people who are visitors.
Welcome is a fine thing to say.
Welcome!
We have wonderous things inside.
Many people have felt that being random is better than being predictible.
It is hard to be predictable while also being random.
When someone says Nonsense, you should tell them to shut up.
When you visit the site, good fortune will grace you.
The poems on this site are generally without grace.
Grace is a gift from the poets.
There are no poets here.
Here there is only randomness.
Poets can write better than Nonsense Engine.
Poets lie at least as much as Nonsense Engine.
Poets have no love of the truth.
Poets have power so long as they have a pen.
Poets tell lies that are more confusing than Nonsense.
Our site is not at all confusing.
Our site is quite confusing.
Our randomness is better than yours.
A pen is used to write words.
Nonsense Engine does not use pens to write its Nonsense.
Nonsense Engine welcomes you.
Words have no power.
Words have only the power that you give them.
Words are created at Nonsense Engine with the express purpose of being odd words.
Would it be odd to say that Nonsense Engine is full of spunk and vive?
