    <%= @language.total_poems %> poems have been generated
    using the vocabulary and "syntax" of <%= @language.name %>.
    <%= @language.num_families %> of them have been generated
    directly by the language (Nonsense from nothing). <%=
    @language.poems_asexually_reproduced %> have been made by copying
    an existing poem and changing it a little (asexual reproduction
    with mututation). <%= @language.poems_sexually_reproduced %> poems
    were created by combining to poems and taking parts from both
    (sexual reproduction). You can read more about how Nonsense Engine
    uses languages to create its nonsense here.
